|------------------|:-----------------:|:--------------------:|-----------------:|
| 6                | 2                 |  5 - 15 minutes      | 12 & Up          |

## Objective
Berry is a two-player competitive abstract strategy game. The goal is to make all Blinks a single color on your turn, or be the first to score 10 points<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>. 

## Setup
Each player starts with 3 blue tiles in their hand. (Note: blue tiles will signal that red is the next color in line)

## Gameplay
Players take turns placing tiles, connecting them together into a cluster. When a tile is placed, the player must click the tile that it connected with to advance that tile to the next color in line. If the placed tile connected to 3 other tiles, then the player must also click the placed tile  in addition to those 3 to advance them all to the next color in line.
```
Colors advance in the following order:
BLUE -> RED -> YELLOW -> BLUE ...
```

When all 6 tiles are placed, the game progresses in the same way, except on a player’s turn, they must select a tile belonging to their current color group and break it from the cluster.* The player may then place this tile as they have done previously.

*Note, however, a tile in the cluster can become ‘locked’ (description of what that looks like) if it has tiles on opposing sides, OR if the tile cannot be broken from the cluster without splitting it into more than 2 smaller clusters.

## WIN CONDITION
The first player to turn all 6 tiles the same color OR score a total of 10 points wins.

## SCORING
Players earn points for forming certain shapes in a singular color on their turn. Reference the chart below for scoring.
